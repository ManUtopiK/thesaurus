So is there any book that just gives you a short run down on like all the "phrases in languages"? Like scanf, read, etc, etc.

# But lo!
There might be one!:

Nope it's dead. The Wayback Machine provides an interesting history. From what I can tell, the [last working copy of the site]( https://web.archive.org/web/20060112210644/http://programmasaurus.org/) is from Jan 2006. In 2007 the site stopped working (showing a Python error message about a missing file). Then the domain expired and was bought up and used for SEO purposes. Currently, it is being used to sell Chinese hair products I think.

Oh hey! But it shows the original author: Creator/Administrator: Michael Mahemoff | http://mahemoff.com | michael@mahemoff.com. Perhaps his website has an updated version of the site?

OK so http://mahemoff.com is dead too. But on the About page (via Wayback Machine again) he says he's switched to blogging on his "new" site, [Software As She's Developed](http://softwareas.com/) and.... IT STILL EXISTS! And has a link to his Twitter and Github. :)

And he responds on Twitter! This is very exciting. TO BE CONTINUED...
