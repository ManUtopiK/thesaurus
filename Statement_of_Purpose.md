# The Programmer's Thesaurus

A thesaurus for programmers!

## Preface
Lately I've become interested in the nomenclature of programming. So often the same idea goes by different names in different languages, and it is a needless hurdle to grokking other people's code. What Wikipedia calls [Associative Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) are variously called:

- "maps" in C++
- "dicts" in Python
- "objects" in JavaScript
- "arrays" in PHP
- "hashes" in Ruby
- "tables" in Lua
- "key-value stores" in NoSQL lingo

Hopefully that is an extreme example. However, it is not unusual for a concept in computer science to go by several names, or for the same name to mean completely different things in different languages! 

This state of affairs is rather ridiculous. The first step towards fixing the problem is recognizing and accepting that we have a problem. Hopefully, this humble thesaurus will be a first step towards a programming lingua franca. We may never agree on syntax, but at least let's try to agree on some [lexical semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_semantics).
